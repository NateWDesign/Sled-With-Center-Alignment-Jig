# Sled With Center Alignment Jig

A version of the sled which leaves in the center part to help with router alignment

This version of the sled leaves the middle puck in place and adds a center hole which can be used to help align the router on the sled.

The original credit for this idea goes to [Stephen_Slagle](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/centering-the-router-on-the-sled/3292) who proposed the idea.

The CAD file for this project can be found here: [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c48fcdcfe5cd17718dd1cf44/w/04c986bcebabe774aed1c2db/e/d430290e75e91849b75dd8de)

The download includes DXF and SVG files for the design, the MakerCAM project file if you just need to tweak the router bit size or such, and ready to run Gcode for a 1/4 inch router bit. Note that tabs are not saved from MakerCAM so you will need to re-add the tabs.

# Alteration with Z-axis Bungee Groove

(Forgive me if this is the wrong way to do this, but I want to contribute)

When first erecting my Maslow I was not satisfied with my z-axis pressure.  This is what I came up with.

It never pushed all the way through the material and causing me a lot of rework after cutting.  However, I liked this bungee as the pressure was adjustable. 

I had cut the previous version of the "Sled With Center Alignment Jig" and really liked it.  So the version I am proposing has grooves to support the bungee in a more conducive way for it to apply pressure to the z-axis.  This is designed around the Ridgid R22002 although the same concept could be adjusted, or even added manually the the previous version.
